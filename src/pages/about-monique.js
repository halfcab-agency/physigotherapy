            <p>Monique has been working as a Physiotherapist since graduating from Curtin University in 2014. She has gained extensive experience in hospitals in Australia and the UK, predominantly in neurological rehabilitation (both acute and sub-acute) and she has worked in community-based, multidisciplinary therapy services within the disability sector since 2018.</p>
            <p>Monique grew up in the country on a farm in the Great Southern Region of WA. She has been living in Perth for the past 12 years since studying her Bachelor of physiotherapy 2011-2014. In her spare time Monique enjoys singing, listening to music, gardening, or participating in fitness or team sports (such as football and netball).</p>
            <p>Monique is passionate about maintaining her understanding of current research and evidence-based practices so that she can continue to provide high-quality and effective therapy services to adults and adolescents. She participates in numerous courses each year to maintain her wide base of knowledge within the sector and in 2021 she completed a Graduate Certificate in Neurological Rehabilitation. Moniqueâ€™s experience and expertise relates to older adolescent and adult populations, so she is best suited to participants of teenage and older.</p>
